What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git stores a .git file to initiate git connected commands on this folder. This is done so that commits can be made on the repository in the future.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It temporarily holds the files that need to be committed. It helps you commit only logical changes.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
This is by transferring only those files onto the staging area that contain a logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are useful when creating new versions or experimenting with the current files while keeping the original working files intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Unreachable commits can easily be spotted and git log paths can be traced.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
All their respective changes are combined into one commit. We can trace their git log path with a diagram.
